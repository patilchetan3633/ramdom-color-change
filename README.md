# Random Color Change Project

This is a simple web project that demonstrates how to implement random color changes using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project showcases how to dynamically change the background color of the page at random intervals, creating an engaging and interactive experience for the user.

## Features:
- **Random Color Generation**: Using JavaScript, the project generates random colors from a pre-defined palette or completely random RGB values.
- **CSS Styling**: The background color is dynamically updated without the need to reload the page, providing a smooth user experience.
- **User Interaction**: Users can trigger color changes by clicking a button or automatically through JavaScript at set intervals.

## How It Works:
1. **HTML**: The structure of the page includes a button that users can click to trigger a color change.
2. **CSS**: The page is styled with a clean, minimalistic design, ensuring that the color transitions are the main focus.
3. **JavaScript**: The script uses the `Math.random()` function to generate random RGB color values and applies them to the background of the page, either on a button click or on an interval timer.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
